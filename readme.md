# Slim webpack/react boilerplate 
Slim webpack/react boilerplate template without unnecessary fluff and stuff.

* Webpack
* React
* Babel (preset: es2015, react)
* ESLint (AirBnB with some modifications)
* Karma (With jasmine)

## Example application

The applications source code is located in the **/src** folder. The project contains a minimal amount of example source code. 
Nobody likes spending time cleaning up a boilerplate template!

Build and run the example application

1. Run command **_npm run build_**. Project is built to the **/build** folder
