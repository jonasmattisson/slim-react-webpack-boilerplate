# Slim webpack/react boilerplate 
Slim webpack/react boilerplate template without unnecessary fluff and stuff.

* Webpack
* React
* Babel (preset: es2015, react)
* ESLint (AirBnB with some modifications)
* Karma (With jasmine)

### Todo

* Setup dev-server with hot-reloading
* Setup tests

## Example application

The applications source code is located in the **/src** folder. The project contains a minimal amount of example source code. 
Nobody likes spending time cleaning up a boilerplate template!

## Getting started
To get started clone the repository and run the command **_npm install_** to install dependencies (_you'll need NodeJs installed_).

1. Clone repository
2. Run command **_npm install_** to install dependencies

Build and run the example application

1. Run command **_npm run build_**. Project is built to the **/build** folder
2. Run command **_npm run serve_** to start a simple dev-server with the **/build/public** as web root.
3. Browse to **localhost:8080** and admire the yet not so awesome application.
